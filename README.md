# Trie_Tree
CSE331 Data Structures And Algorithms in C++ Course Project

A trie (derived from retrieval) is a multiway tree data structure used for storing strings over an alphabet. It is used to store a large amount of strings. The pattern matching can be done efficiently using tries. The idea is that all strings sharing common prefix should come from a common node. The tries are used in spell checking programs.
